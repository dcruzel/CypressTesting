## CypressTesting

## Description
```md
This project is to take the starter codebase of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhance it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.
